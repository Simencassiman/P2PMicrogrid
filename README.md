# P2PMicrogrid
This repository contains the code for my master's thesis on Peer-to-Peer electrical grids. It is built on top of [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org).

The idea is to train a set of agents using reinforcement learning to agree on electricity prices to trade within their electricity community.
